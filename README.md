📌 UI/UX Design Task 3 – CRM / SaaS Dashboard

By Future Interns (2026)

📖 Project Overview

ChatPanda CRM is a web-based SaaS dashboard designed for small digital agencies to manage leads, clients, and follow-ups efficiently.
This project focuses on workflow-based UX design rather than visual screens alone.

The goal was to design a real-world CRM interface similar to tools used by agencies, consulting firms, and SaaS startups.

🎯 Objective

Track leads across different stages

Manage active clients clearly

Plan tasks and follow-ups

Improve daily workflow efficiency

Reduce missed follow-ups

This mirrors how professional SaaS products are designed for business use.

🏢 Real-World Scenario

CRM dashboard for a small digital agency

Team size: 5 members

Clients managed: 30+

Daily use: Lead tracking, client follow-ups, internal task planning

🧠 UX & Workflow Design

The dashboard is structured around a simple agency workflow:

Lead → Client → Follow-up → Task → Conversion

Key UX principles applied:

Clear information hierarchy

Scannable dashboards

Data-focused UI

Desktop-first SaaS layout

Scalable design for growing datasets

🖥️ Key Screens Designed

Dashboard overview with KPI cards

Lead pipeline with status-based stages

Client list and client profile view

Task & follow-up management screen

Activity overview for daily operations

🎨 Visual Design

Clean white background with soft blue accents

Rounded cards and subtle shadows

Professional B2B SaaS aesthetic

Minimal and distraction-free layout

A subtle ChatPanda mascot is used only in supportive contexts (empty states and guidance) to maintain friendliness without harming usability.
