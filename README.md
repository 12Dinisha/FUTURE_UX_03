📌 UI/UX Design Task 3 – CRM / SaaS Dashboard

By Future Interns (2026)

📖 Project Overview

ChatPanda CRM is a web-based SaaS dashboard designed for small digital agencies to manage leads, clients, and follow-ups efficiently.
This project focuses on workflow-based UX design rather than visual screens alone.

The goal was to design a real-world CRM interface similar to tools used by agencies, consulting firms, and SaaS startups.
