🧠 Design Rationale – ChatPanda CRM Dashboard

The ChatPanda CRM dashboard was designed to solve common problems faced by small agencies, such as scattered lead data, missed follow-ups, and lack of visibility into client status.

The layout prioritizes:

Quick access to critical information

Clear status indicators

Minimal cognitive load

Daily usability for business teams

The panda mascot was introduced subtly to humanize the interface and improve approachability without interfering with data-heavy workflows.

This design reflects real SaaS UX practices used in agency and B2B environments.
